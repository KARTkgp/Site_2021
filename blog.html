                      <hr class="hr mx-auto" />
                      <p>
                        We all know that an internal combustion engine burns
                        fuel to produce power which spins the wheels in an
                        automobile. But the second law of thermodynamics makes
                        sure that only a part of the energy of the fuel can be
                        converted to useful power. The rest converts to heat,
                        some of which leaves the engine through the exhaust,
                        while some of it tends to remain and heat the parts in
                        proximity. If this heat is not taken care of, it can
                        cause damage. And so, we have coolant running around the
                        engine to prevent it from overheating. This coolant then
                        flows into the radiator, where it loses its heat to the
                        surrounding air.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        But how does this heat transfer happen? The name
                        radiator sure is misleading in this context- because it
                        is not at all designed to lose heat through radiation.
                        Rather, it applies the other two modes of heat transfer
                        known to us- conduction and convection. The heat from
                        the coolant first passes from the inner surface of the
                        radiator tubes to the outer surface and subsequently to
                        the fins through conduction. Then, convection causes the
                        fins to lose heat to the flowing air.

                          <p>
                            Let’s dig a little deeper into this. In an IC
                            Engine, the energy of the fuel is divided into three
                            parts: horsepower, exhaust heat and cooling system
                            load, which is the term for heat handled by the
                            radiator. The heat to be lost per unit time
                            (measured in BTUs) by the radiator at a particular
                            rpm is almost constant. What we need is a radiator
                            which keeps the inlet temperature (of coolant coming
                            from engine) low enough to prevent the engine from
                            overheating. In simple words, this means that both a
                            good and a bad radiator transfer the same BTUs per
                            minute to the surroundings. However, the good
                            radiator does so while keeping the engine
                            temperature well within safe limits, and the bad
                            radiator fails to keep this temperature under check.
                          </p>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        The heat transferred by convection is directly
                        proportional to the difference of average radiator core
                        temperature (the mean of the radiator inlet and outlet
                        temperatures) and the ambient air temperature. It also
                        depends on the surface area available for heat transfer
                        and the speed of flowing air. The job of increasing the
                        surface area within the space available is achieved with
                        the help of fins and the job of increasing airflow speed
                        is done by installing fans which suck air into the
                        radiator. These factors lead to a smaller temperature
                        difference for the same heat transfer, which in turn
                        causes the average core temperature and correspondingly
                        the engine temperature to reduce. One thing to be noted
                        here is that even though increasing fin density would
                        result in better radiator performance, it has to be kept
                        within a limit, otherwise it poses restrictions to the
                        airflow, thus negating the advantage of increased
                        surface area.

                      <p>
                        The heat loss rate of the coolant can be calculated by
                        multiplying the temperature drop of coolant in the
                        radiator with the mass flow rate of coolant and its
                        specific heat. Since this heat loss rate is equal to the
                        cooling system load, we can conclude that increasing the
                        coolant flow rate (by using a stronger coolant pump)
                        will lead to a decreased temperature drop, thus
                        increasing the radiator outlet temperature and reducing
                        the inlet temperature, giving better cooling
                        performance.

                            TAnother thing to put light upon is the dimensioning
                            of the radiator. The frontal surface area of the
                            radiator is usually kept large, to expose more
                            coolant to undisturbed airflow, but is limited by
                            the space availability. On the other hand, the
                            thickness of the radiator is a quantity to be well
                            optimized. As the air traverses the thickness of the
                            radiator, it gets warmed up, and on the backside,
                            its cooling efficiency diminishes. The thickness
                            should be kept only to the point where cooling is
                            still effective.

                        The performance of the radiator also depends largely
                        upon the material used for building it. The material
                        should be such that it allows high conduction as well as
                        convection rates. The most commonly used materials which
                        have such properties are copper, brass and aluminium.
                        All these factors sum up to keep your engine cool and
                        running.

                        It may seem antithetic: Aerodynamics and tyre dynamics
                        and yet a deeper understanding into the behaviour of
                        wings and tyres may insinuate a strong connection. These
                        two areas certainly have had some mystery in their past
                        may it be the mysterious force of lift or grip offered
                        by tyres. These two areas are certainly fascinating
                        which may seem ironic in the case of rubber, but when
                        one dwells deeper it will certainly captivate one’s
                        thought.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        The linearity in the coefficient of lift v/s angle of
                        attack curve of thin aerofoil sections is akin to the
                        lateral force v/s slip angle curve in a tyre. This
                        interesting connection may seem very subtle and perhaps
                        inconclusive of their deep connection, but in the view
                        of control systems this property is crucial and anything
                        that a control systems engineer would love to work with.
                        Well, as a matter of fact the linearity in the
                        coefficient of lift v/s angle of attack curve has been
                        proved in theory (thin aerofoil theory) as well as in
                        practice however the same in the case of a tyre has no
                        solid theoretical background but agrees well with
                        experimental data.

                            Another alluring congruence between the two seems to
                            take the same name perhaps for the similarity that
                            it holds: Camber. Camber as in aerodynamics is the
                            asymmetry of the aerofoil section above and below
                            the dividing chord line. Camber with respect to tyre
                            is its inclination in the rear view of a car.
                            Although there can be no real similarities in their
                            definitions, their effect is however to raise the
                            above curves off the x-axis (either below or above
                            depending on the sign of camber). A negative
                            cambered aerofoil generally tends to change the
                            momentum of the flow more aggressively than a
                            symmetrical aerofoil and hence the higher lift at
                            the same angle of attack.... The penalty to this
                            advantage is a lower stall angle in cambered
                            aerofoils owing to earlier onset of separation
                            catered by a more rigorous suction surface geometry.
                            The reason for elevated lateral forces in a cambered
                            tyre leaning into the curve can be accounted for by
                            lateral distortion of the contact patch or the tire
                            print. The camber thrust that is obtained is however
                            more complex as it is a function of numerous
                            variables like tyre type, tyre pressure, tread,
                            load, tractive effort, camber and slip angle.

                        To add to the list is the induced drag which in wings is
                        caused by the inclination of the lift vector by velocity
                        induction by tip vortices and in tyres is because of the
                        oblique incidence of the side force or the lateral force
                        vector to the velocity vector.

                        The heat loss rate of the coolant can be calculated by
                        multiplying the temperature drop of coolant in the
                        radiator with the mass flow rate of coolant and its
                        specific heat. Since this heat loss rate is equal to the
                        cooling system load, we can conclude that increasing the
                        coolant flow rate (by using a stronger coolant pump)
                        will lead to a decreased temperature drop, thus
                        increasing the radiator outlet temperature and reducing
                        the inlet temperature, giving better cooling
                        performance.

                            The boundary layer over a wing can be thought of as
                            analogous to the tire print where all the mystery
                            remains concealed. The boundary layer is very thin,
                            however it encloses within it very interesting
                            concepts like the occirrence of
                            Tollmein-Schilichting waves at the onset of
                            turbulence during transition, the division of
                            different layers within a turbulent boundary layer
                            dictated by the values of viscous stresses and
                            reynolds stresses , the law of wall critical in
                            modelling of near wall flows, quassi periodic
                            sequence of events resulting in hair-pin voritices
                            and their susceptibility to Helmholtz’s instability
                            within the viscous sub-layer and many such
                            fascinating concepts. The tyre print on the other
                            hand is in no way less sophisticated and involves
                            hysterisis of compression and expansion of tyre
                            tread to produce the asymmetrical lateral force
                            distribution partly responsible for the mysterious
                            aligning torque along with the mechanical trail.
                            This hysterisis is also responsible for the
                            asymmtric distribution of normal force in the tyre
                            print. A less noticeable phenomenon is standing wave
                            in a rolling tyre at high speeds caused by a delay
                            in the tread emerging from the tire print snapping
                            back to its orbit around the wheel and in case of
                            excessive speed it may lead to a shock wave
                            analogous to aerodynamics leading to disintegration
                            of the tyre.

                      <p>
                        This topic is completely about the love story between
                        the tyres and the road.Well not one of the same cliched
                        love stories but a story which includes maths and
                        mechanics.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        When you are riding a car,you must have experienced some
                        forces acting on you while the car accelerates,brakes or
                        moves around a turn.The tires provide the necessary
                        longitudinal and lateral forces in order to help the car
                        move around a corner and also during acceleration and
                        braking.These forces are produced by the deformation of
                        the tire during the different movements of the car.

                          <p>
                            When the car moves straight ahead,the rolling tire
                            moves straight along the wheel plane.But when the
                            car maneuvers around a corner the tire tends to
                            “slip” on the road, i.e. the motion of the tire will
                            no more be in the same direction as the motion of
                            the wheel plane.The angle between the direction of
                            motion and the direction of wheel travel is called
                            slip angle (α).This slip produces a lateral force Fy
                            at the tire-ground interface. Now this particular Fy
                            acts a little behind the centre of the wheel
                            producing a moment Mz which aligns the wheel along
                            the direction of rotation.

                      <p>
                        This curve gives an idea about how the slip angle
                        changes with lateral force for three different types of
                        tires,Now, for small values of α ,the relationship is
                        nearly linear,and the slope of this curve is called the
                        cornering stiffness (Cα).

                        The magic formula is incorporated in a computer program
                        (preferably MATLAB) in order to check the fitting for
                        different tires and conclude the tire behaviour at a
                        different environment.

                            To add to the list is the induced drag which in
                            wings is caused by the inclination of the lift
                            vector by velocity induction by tip vortices and in
                            tyres is because of the oblique incidence of the
                            side force or the lateral force vector to the
                            velocity vector. The boundary layer over a wing can
                            be thought of as analogous to the tire print where
                            all the mystery remains concealed. The boundary
                            layer is very thin, however it encloses within it
                            very interesting concepts like the occirrence of
                            Tollmein-Schilichting waves at the onset of
                            turbulence during transition, the division of
                            different layers within a turbulent boundary layer
                            dictated by the values of viscous stresses and
                            reynolds stresses , the law of wall critical in
                            modelling of near wall flows, quassi periodic
                            sequence of events resulting in hair-pin voritices
                            and their susceptibility to Helmholtz’s instability
                            within the viscous sub-layer and many such
                            fascinating concepts. The tyre print on the other
                            hand is in no way less sophisticated and involves
                            hysterisis of compression and expansion of tyre
                            tread to produce the asymmetrical lateral force
                            distribution partly responsible for the mysterious
                            aligning torque along with the mechanical trail.
                            This hysterisis is also responsible for the
                            asymmtric distribution of normal force in the tyre
                            print. A less noticeable phenomenon is standing wave
                            in a rolling tyre at high speeds caused by a delay
                            in the tread emerging from the tire print snapping
                            back to its orbit around the wheel and in case of
                            excessive speed it may lead to a shock wave
                            analogous to aerodynamics leading to disintegration
                            of the tyre.

                        The general form of the magic formula is : R(k)=d. sin [
                        c.arctan { b (1-e) k+e.arctan (bk) } ] Where b,c,d,e
                        represents fitting constants and R is the required force
                        or moment depending on slip parameter k. Fit done in
                        MATLAB.Red dots indicate observed values and black
                        spline indicate the magic formula fit. Parcejka’s tire
                        models are used extensively in Vehicular dynamics in
                        formula racing competitions and also used in gaming
                        simulations.
