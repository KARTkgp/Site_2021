                      <!-- <p>
                        We all know that an internal combustion engine burns
                        fuel to produce power which spins the wheels in an
                        automobile. But the second law of thermodynamics makes
                        sure that only a part of the energy of the fuel can be
                        converted to useful power. The rest converts to heat,
                        some of which leaves the engine through the exhaust,
                        while some of it tends to remain and heat the parts in
                        proximity. If this heat is not taken care of, it can
                        cause damage. And so, we have coolant running around the
                        engine to prevent it from overheating. This coolant then
                        flows into the radiator, where it loses its heat to the
                        surrounding air.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        But how does this heat transfer happen? The name
                        radiator sure is misleading in this context- because it
                        is not at all designed to lose heat through radiation.
                        Rather, it applies the other two modes of heat transfer
                        known to us- conduction and convection. The heat from
                        the coolant first passes from the inner surface of the
                        radiator tubes to the outer surface and subsequently to
                        the fins through conduction. Then, convection causes the
                        fins to lose heat to the flowing air.
                      </p>

                        <p class="align-self-stretch">
                          Let’s dig a little deeper into this. In an IC Engine,
                          the energy of the fuel is divided into three parts:
                          horsepower, exhaust heat and cooling system load,
                          which is the term for heat handled by the radiator.
                          The heat to be lost per unit time (measured in BTUs)
                          by the radiator at a particular rpm is almost
                          constant. What we need is a radiator which keeps the
                          inlet temperature (of coolant coming from engine) low
                          enough to prevent the engine from overheating. In
                          simple words, this means that both a good and a bad
                          radiator transfer the same BTUs per minute to the
                          surroundings. However, the good radiator does so while
                          keeping the engine temperature well within safe
                          limits, and the bad radiator fails to keep this
                          temperature under check.

                        The heat transferred by convection is directly
                        proportional to the difference of average radiator core
                        temperature (the mean of the radiator inlet and outlet
                        temperatures) and the ambient air temperature. It also
                        depends on the surface area available for heat transfer
                        and the speed of flowing air. The job of increasing the
                        surface area within the space available is achieved with
                        the help of fins and the job of increasing airflow speed
                        is done by installing fans which suck air into the
                        radiator. These factors lead to a smaller temperature
                        difference for the same heat transfer, which in turn
                        causes the average core temperature and correspondingly
                        the engine temperature to reduce. One thing to be noted
                        here is that even though increasing fin density would
                        result in better radiator performance, it has to be kept
                        within a limit, otherwise it poses restrictions to the
                        airflow, thus negating the advantage of increased
                        surface area.

                        The heat loss rate of the coolant can be calculated by
                        multiplying the temperature drop of coolant in the
                        radiator with the mass flow rate of coolant and its
                        specific heat. Since this heat loss rate is equal to the
                        cooling system load, we can conclude that increasing the
                        coolant flow rate (by using a stronger coolant pump)
                        will lead to a decreased temperature drop, thus
                        increasing the radiator outlet temperature and reducing
                        the inlet temperature, giving better cooling
                        performance.

                          TAnother thing to put light upon is the dimensioning
                          of the radiator. The frontal surface area of the
                          radiator is usually kept large, to expose more coolant
                          to undisturbed airflow, but is limited by the space
                          availability. On the other hand, the thickness of the
                          radiator is a quantity to be well optimized. As the
                          air traverses the thickness of the radiator, it gets
                          warmed up, and on the backside, its cooling efficiency
                          diminishes. The thickness should be kept only to the
                          point where cooling is still effective.

                      <p>
                        The performance of the radiator also depends largely
                        upon the material used for building it. The material
                        should be such that it allows high conduction as well as
                        convection rates. The most commonly used materials which
                        have such properties are copper, brass and aluminium.
                        All these factors sum up to keep your engine cool and
                        running.

                      We all know that an internal combustion engine burns fuel
                      to produce power which spins the wheels in an automobile.
                      But the second law of thermodynamics makes sure that only
                      a part of the energy of the fuel can be converted to
                      useful power. The rest converts to heat, some of which
                      leaves the engine through the exhaust, while some of it
                      tends to remain and heat the parts in proximity. If this
                      heat is not taken care of, it can cause damage. And so, we
                      have coolant running around the engine to prevent it from
                      overheating. This coolant then flows into the radiator,
                      where it loses its heat to the surrounding air.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      But how does this heat transfer happen? The name radiator
                      sure is misleading in this context- because it is not at
                      all designed to lose heat through radiation. Rather, it
                      applies the other two modes of heat transfer known to us-
                      conduction and convection. The heat from the coolant first
                      passes from the inner surface of the radiator tubes to the
                      outer surface and subsequently to the fins through
                      conduction. Then, convection causes the fins to lose heat
                      to the flowing air.

                          Let’s dig a little deeper into this. In an IC Engine,
                          the energy of the fuel is divided into three parts:
                          horsepower, exhaust heat and cooling system load,
                          which is the term for heat handled by the radiator.
                          The heat to be lost per unit time (measured in BTUs)
                          by the radiator at a particular rpm is almost
                          constant. What we need is a radiator which keeps the
                          inlet temperature (of coolant coming from engine) low
                          enough to prevent the engine from overheating. In
                          simple words, this means that both a good and a bad
                          radiator transfer the same BTUs per minute to the
                          surroundings. However, the good radiator does so while
                          keeping the engine temperature well within safe
                          limits, and the bad radiator fails to keep this

                      The linearity in the coefficient of lift v/s angle of
                      attack curve of thin aerofoil sections is akin to the
                      lateral force v/s slip angle curve in a tyre. This
                      interesting connection may seem very subtle and perhaps
                      inconclusive of their deep connection, but in the view of
                      control systems this property is crucial and anything that
                      a control systems engineer would love to work with. Well,
                      as a matter of fact the linearity in the coefficient of
                      lift v/s angle of attack curve has been proved in theory
                      (thin aerofoil theory) as well as in practice however the
                      same in the case of a tyre has no solid theoretical
                      background but agrees well with experimental data.

                      Another alluring congruence between the two seems to take
                      the same name perhaps for the similarity that it holds:
                      Camber. Camber as in aerodynamics is the asymmetry of the
                      aerofoil section above and below the dividing chord line.
                      Camber with respect to tyre is its inclination in the rear
                      view of a car. Although there can be no real similarities
                      in their definitions, their effect is however to raise the
                      above curves off the x-axis (either below or above
                      depending on the sign of camber). A negative cambered
                      aerofoil generally tends to change the momentum of the
                      flow more aggressively than a symmetrical aerofoil and
                      hence the higher lift at the same angle of attack.... The
                      penalty to this advantage is a lower stall angle in
                      cambered aerofoils owing to earlier onset of separation
                      catered by a more rigorous suction surface geometry. The
                      reason for elevated lateral forces in a cambered tyre
                      leaning into the curve can be accounted for by lateral
                      distortion of the contact patch or the tire print. The
                      camber thrust that is obtained is however more complex as
                      it is a function of numerous variables like tyre type,
                      tyre pressure, tread, load, tractive effort, camber and
                      slip angle.

                      The heat loss rate of the coolant can be calculated by
                      multiplying the temperature drop of coolant in the
                      radiator with the mass flow rate of coolant and its
                      specific heat. Since this heat loss rate is equal to the
                      cooling system load, we can conclude that increasing the
                      coolant flow rate (by using a stronger coolant pump) will
                      lead to a decreased temperature drop, thus increasing the
                      radiator outlet temperature and reducing the inlet
                      temperature, giving better cooling performance.

                      The boundary layer over a wing can be thought of as
                      analogous to the tire print where all the mystery remains
                      concealed. The boundary layer is very thin, however it
                      encloses within it very interesting concepts like the
                      occirrence of Tollmein-Schilichting waves at the onset of
                      turbulence during transition, the division of different
                      layers within a turbulent boundary layer dictated by the
                      values of viscous stresses and reynolds stresses , the law
                      of wall critical in modelling of near wall flows, quassi
                      periodic sequence of events resulting in hair-pin
                      voritices and their susceptibility to Helmholtz’s
                      instability within the viscous sub-layer and many such
                      fascinating concepts. The tyre print on the other hand is
                      in no way less sophisticated and involves hysterisis of
                      compression and expansion of tyre tread to produce the
                      asymmetrical lateral force distribution partly responsible
                      for the mysterious aligning torque along with the
                      mechanical trail. This hysterisis is also responsible for
                      the asymmtric distribution of normal force in the tyre
                      print. A less noticeable phenomenon is standing wave in a
                      rolling tyre at high speeds caused by a delay in the tread
                      emerging from the tire print snapping back to its orbit
                      around the wheel and in case of excessive speed it may
                      lead to a shock wave analogous to aerodynamics leading to
                      disintegration of the tyre.

                      This topic is completely about the love story between the
                      tyres and the road.Well not one of the same cliched love

                      <br />

                      When you are riding a car,you must have experienced some
                      forces acting on you while the car accelerates,brakes or
                      moves around a turn.The tires provide the necessary
                      longitudinal and lateral forces in order to help the car
                      move around a corner and also during acceleration and
                      braking.These forces are produced by the deformation of
                      the tire during the different movements of the car.

                      <br />
                      <br />

                      <div class="row text-center justify-content-center">
                        <div class="col-xl-4 col-12">

                      <br />
                      <br />

                      When the car moves straight ahead,the rolling tire moves
                      straight along the wheel plane.But when the car maneuvers
                      around a corner the tire tends to “slip” on the road, i.e.
                      the motion of the tire will no more be in the same
                      direction as the motion of the wheel plane.The angle
                      between the direction of motion and the direction of wheel
                      travel is called slip angle (α).This slip produces a
                      lateral force Fy at the tire-ground interface. Now this
                      particular Fy acts a little behind the centre of the wheel
                      producing a moment Mz which aligns the wheel along the
                      direction of rotation.

                      <br />
                      <br />

                      This curve gives an idea about how the slip angle changes
                      with lateral force for three different types of tires,Now,
                      for small values of α ,the relationship is nearly
                      linear,and the slope of this curve is called the cornering
                      stiffness (Cα).

                      <br />
                      <br />

                      The magic formula is incorporated in a computer program
                      (preferably MATLAB) in order to check the fitting for
                      different tires and conclude the tire behaviour at a
                      different environment.

                      turbulence during transition, the division of different
                      layers within a turbulent boundary layer dictated by the
                      values of viscous stresses and reynolds stresses , the law
                      of wall critical in modelling of near wall flows, quassi
                      periodic sequence of events resulting in hair-pin
                      voritices and their susceptibility to Helmholtz’s
                      instability within the viscous sub-layer and many such
                      fascinating concepts. The tyre print on the other hand is
                      in no way less sophisticated and involves hysterisis of
                      compression and expansion of tyre tread to produce the
                      asymmetrical lateral force distribution partly responsible
                      for the mysterious aligning torque along with the
                      mechanical trail. This hysterisis is also responsible for
                      the asymmtric distribution of normal force in the tyre
                      print. A less noticeable phenomenon is standing wave in a
                      rolling tyre at high speeds caused by a delay in the tread
                      emerging from the tire print snapping back to its orbit
                      around the wheel and in case of excessive speed it may
                      lead to a shock wave analogous to aerodynamics leading to
                      disintegration of the tyre.

                      The general form of the magic formula is : R(k)=d. sin [
                      c.arctan { b (1-e) k+e.arctan (bk) } ] Where b,c,d,e
                      represents fitting constants and R is the required force
                      or moment depending on slip parameter k.

                      Fit done in MATLAB.Red dots indicate observed values and
                      black spline indicate the magic formula fit. Parcejka’s
                      tire models are used extensively in Vehicular dynamics in
                      formula racing competitions and also used in gaming
                      simulations.
